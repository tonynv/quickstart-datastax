## DataStax Enterprise (DSE) on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start deploys DataStax Enterprise (DSE) automatically into an AWS Cloud configuration of your choice.

DSE is the always-on data platform for cloud applications that is powered by Apache Cassandra. DSE is designed to handle big data workloads across multiple nodes with no single point of failure, by employing a peer-to-peer distributed system for data across homogeneous nodes. Integrated within each node of DSE is powerful indexing, search, analytics, and graph functionality, provided by combining Cassandra with Apache Solr, Apache Spark, and DSE Graph.

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying DataStax Enterprise into a new VPC
- Deploying DataStax Enterprise into an existing VPC 

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
